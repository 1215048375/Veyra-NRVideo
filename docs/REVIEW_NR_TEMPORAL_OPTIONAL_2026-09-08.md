Existing P2 diagnostic gap found: tests/integration/RepairShaderTests.cpp still uses8 residual constants, actual shader requires24. Current graph image matrix uses24 correctly, but that old standalone harness cannot prove the current contract. Next atomic task fixes and validates this harness, then Q6 adds bounds/photometric motion checks and measuresFG; Q7 and natural comparisons remain open. FullGoal/Phase7in_progress; no practical capture/long-term/distribution acceptance claimed.

Scope: synthetic fixed hard masks only; no moving or feathered mask temporal proof, natural footage, internal HUD exclusion, SR/FG protection or Q6/Q7 approval. Reviewer did not build; it ran the identified binaries. Initial wrapper failure due Maker documentation write during gate is recorded in JOURNAL, then frozen maker and independent gates passed.
