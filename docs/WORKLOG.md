# Veyra Worklog

## 2026-09-02 Phase 2 — RenoDX-equivalent parity codec (gate 35/35 + reviewer PASS)

Goal:

Implement the parity codec end to end: CPU golden reference (Playbook §9 exact math), ParityEncode/ParityDecode HLSL compiled at build time, the harness --parity-compare mode (Original FP16 → encode → 16 Feature-18 evaluates → decode → Final FP16), GPU-vs-CPU statistics, four-stage captures, and the phase2 gate.

Changed:

- include/veyra/parity + src/parity: RenoDxParityCodec (shoulder 0.75/5.7780, sRGB, six OkLab/AP1 matrices in mul(matrix,vector) direction, signed cbrt, HueOkLab, UpgradeToneMap two-stage, luminance-only).
- tests/unit/ParityCpuReference.cpp: 12 golden checks (threshold continuity, neutral bypass identity, highlight luminance restoration, quantization bounds).
- shaders/Parity{Encode,Decode}.hlsl + cmake shader targets; tools/nr_harness parity_compare mode + shared harness_util (PNG writer, JSON, stats).
- scripts/gates/phase2.ps1: CPU tests both configs, GPU-vs-CPU tolerances, four-stage captures, neutral baseline + addon hash, raw≠final.

Commands actually run (key evidence):

- veyra_parity_tests: 12/12, 0 failures in both configs.
- --parity-compare: encode maxCodeDelta=1 (≤1), maxAlphaDelta=0; decode beyondOneUlpCount=0, maxAbsError=0.00390625 (= exactly 1 FP16 ulp at [4,8)), nanInf=0; infoqueue stored=0 errors=0 (debug run persisted).
- loop-gate -Gate phase2: 35/35 checks exit 0 (reproduced identically by the reviewer in an independent run).

Reviewer outcome (P2.6):

- First review: FAIL with 1×P1 (an evidence line about the debug parity run had no persisted artifact — same class as the Phase 1 P1) + 6×P2.
- Fixes: unconditional infoqueue drain with counters into the JSON, a real persisted debug run, RNE float→half (matching GPU storage), alpha comparison, stage luma statistics into the JSON, stage JSON enriched with rowPitch/runtimeSha256/pts/source.
- The RNE fix surfaced a real physical effect: highlight-amplified fp32-vs-double intermediate differences cross FP16 bucket boundaries (5038 of 2M pixels, every one exactly 1 ulp; bit-level examples in the log). The absolute 0.002 bound is mathematically unreachable at ≥4.0 for any correct fp32 pipeline, so the gate enforces diff ≤ max(0.002, 1×stored ulp) — the reviewer examined the worst-pixel evidence and accepted this ruling as the same-intent bound (0.002 verbatim below 4.0).
- Final review: VERDICT PASS (three-way reproducible numbers, control plane untouched from the Phase 1 checkpoint). Three one-line P2s fixed immediately; two P2s filed for Phase 3 (--profile parsing, in-flight parameter-block reuse hardening).

Decision:

- All parity math comes from Playbook §9; every tolerance kept falsifiable; every claim backed by a persisted artifact.

Next single task:

Phase 3 P3.1: vcpkg/FFmpeg 310-baseline dependency acquisition + phase3 gate (fail-closed).


## 2026-09-02 Phase 1 — Feature 18 native harness (gate 54/55, one user-action item)

Goal:

Build the Feature 18 harness end to end: NGX core host, isolated caller-name compatibility layer, signed-snippet Create/Evaluate, deterministic test-pattern Proxy, 300-frame runs with statistics/captures/variants, and the phase1 gate.

Changed:

- include/veyra/ngx + src/ngx: NgxCoreHost (single Init/Shutdown, parameter-block lifecycle, SEH), ParameterBlock typed setters, DlssNrParameters constants, DlssNrRuntimeAdapter (restricted load, 5 exports, PE-import IAT shim with single-owner install/restore, SEH-wrapped snippet calls, scaling-ratio callback).
- shaders/GenerateTestPattern.hlsl + cmake/VeyraShaders.cmake: build-time DXC compile (deterministic quadrant pattern with frameId shift).
- tools/nr_harness: --load-only/--shim-test/--create-test and the full frame loop (Proxy->Feature18->Raw, zero guidance via upload-copy, 4-slot execution, PNG captures, statistics, variant segments, GPU timestamps, gate-contract JSON).
- NgxResult: full official 310.7 result table (Success=0x1 — corrected from an earlier wrong assumption).

Commands actually run (key evidence):

- Core Init_with_ProjectID result=0x1; snippet Init_Ext (AppID 0x0876232C) result=0x1; CreateFeature id=18 result=0x1 handle non-null; Release/Shutdown results all 0x1.
- Shim boundary battery: 8/8 PASS (zero-size, truncation with ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER, exact 10-wchar, roomy, nullptr/other-module forwarding, restore verified).
- 300/300 Evaluate succeeded in BOTH Debug and Release (0 failures), output meanLuma≈0.494 stddev≈0.327 non-black non-constant; three distinct hashes (baseline / style=1 / intensity=0.5); GPU timestamps non-zero, avg ≈6.3 ms/frame at 1080p.
- Lifecycle: two consecutive full runs + create-test + shim-test 4/4 PASS.
- loop-gate -Gate phase1: **54/55 checks PASS; the single FAIL is json-debug:debug-layer-enabled (debugLayer=False)**.

Artifacts/logs:

- logs/phase1/824a66eca2bd4ebfb23a28950eecbc8f/ (gate runs), logs/tmp/p16*.json/out, captures (gitignored).
- third_party_local/nvidia/DLSS_SDK_310.7.0 staged from the official GitHub repo clone (headers + nvsdk_ngx_s[_dbg].lib + rel DLLs; nvngx_dlss.dll BE6E434A…, nvngx_dlssg.dll 135EAF07…).

Failures and exact codes:

- ClearUnorderedAccessViewFloat crashed (139) during zero-init even after binding heaps; replaced with an upload-buffer copy path (equally deterministic). Root cause unverifiable without the debug layer; noted for re-check after Graphics Tools is installed.
- Compile iterations: SDK header include order (d3d12.h before nvsdk_ngx.h), Init_with_ProjectID casing (capital D), NVIDIA static libs are MT-flavored (switched tools to static CRT via CMP0091 + per-config _dbg lib), DXC argument quoting via generator expressions (switched to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE branch), union aggregate init.

Decision:

- NGX result table and all signatures come from the staged official 310.7 headers, never memory.
- Zero-init via upload copy; JSON debugLayer reports the actual runtime state.

Next single task (user action required):

~~Install Windows "Graphics Tools"~~ (user installed 2026-09-02; probe verified "d3d12 debug layer enabled").

Reviewer outcome (P1.8, 2026-09-02):

- First review: VERDICT FAIL with 1×P1 — the gate's no-state-errors grep was vacuous because no component captured the debug layer's OutputDebugString stream; plus 5×P2 (literal log line, path containment, SEH on parameter calls, hardcoded nanCount, 10-frame debug matrix).
- Fixes landed (commit ff98e37): real ID3D12InfoQueue capture in debug builds (attach after device creation, drain after the full loop into the log and a debugInfoQueue JSON block), gate now asserts infoqueue-active and no-error-messages (both falsifiable), debug run raised to 30 frames, exact Playbook 8.1 literal, runtime_local/nvidia containment check, SEH wrappers for Allocate/DestroyParameters, nanCount removed.
- Final review: VERDICT PASS (independent fresh-build run: release 300/300, debug 30/30 with infoQueue active and 0 error messages; three parameter-variant hashes identical across four independent runs; anti-stale runId/exeSha256 verified; control plane untouched from the Phase 0 checkpoint). Three non-blocking P2 residuals recorded in the journal (teardown-time infoqueue drain, suffix vs prefix containment, 200-message drain cap).

Phase 1 conclusion: gate 56/56 + reviewer PASS. Phase 2 unlocked.


## 2026-09-02 Phase 0 — Runtime probe + D3D12 skeleton

Goal:

Complete Phase 0 per the Playbook: fail-closed phase0 gate, minimal CMake/C++20 project, veyra_base (logger/result strings/file identity), veyra_gfx (D3D12DeviceContext + 4-slot ring), full veyra_runtime_probe, and the real gate run including the 5-minute window loop.

Changed:

- Initialized local Git per LOOP_ENGINE fixed order (baseline 2086282, branch agent/veyra-v1-loop, loop pointer commit 09abf5d).
- Added scripts/gates/phase0.ps1 (fail-closed, verified failing before the project existed).
- Added CMakeLists.txt/CMakePresets.json/cmake/VeyraWarnings.cmake (Ninja x64 debug/release, /W4 /permissive- /WX).
- Added scripts/build.ps1 (vswhere/vcvars resolution; no machine paths in presets) and scripts/stage-runtime.ps1 (pinned-identity copy + manifest + persistent ngx-local.json).
- Added include/veyra + src/base (Logger, Status/HRESULT/NGX strings, BCrypt SHA-256 + WinVerifyTrust + signer extraction) and src/gfx (D3D12DeviceContext, CommandSlotRing with timestamp heap).
- Implemented tools/runtime_probe/main.cpp: --self-test, --device-info, full mode (restricted LoadLibraryExW, 5 exports, nvofapi64 probe, fixed-size window + flip swapchain + 4-slot loop, JSON summary with runId/exeSha256).

Commands actually run:

- preflight (54 checks then 66 after Git): exit 0 both times.
- Toolchain/GPU probes: RTX 5070 / 616.56 / 12227 MiB / compute 12.0; nvofapi64 32.0.16.1656; MSVC 14.44.35207; CMake 3.31.6; Ninja 1.12.1; DXC 1.8; Git 2.53.
- scripts/build.ps1 -Preset x64-debug / x64-release: exit 0 (multiple times).
- veyra_runtime_probe --self-test / --device-info / full smoke: exit 0 each.
- loop-gate.ps1 -Gate phase0: three honest failures (locale version format; SwitchParameter binding via -File; ignore probe on non-existent dirs), each fixed without lowering thresholds, then **exit 0: VEYRA GATE PASSED: phase0 (70 checks)**.

Results:

- Gate run-id a5fd6348b3084b44857b1f1ffc96a449 (308.3 s): exports 5/5; Debug window 3 s / 303 frames; Release window **300 s / 30002 frames, deviceRemoved=false**; staged runtime identity matches the pinned contract; git ignore 7/7; no sensitive files tracked.
- Driver version resolves via registry nvlddmkm.sys file version (32.0.16.1656); DisplayVersion value absent on this driver.
- D3D12 debug layer unavailable on this machine (0x887A002D, Windows "Graphics Tools" optional feature missing); recorded in loop/INBOX.md for user action before Phase 1.

Artifacts/logs:

- logs/phase0/a5fd6348b3084b44857b1f1ffc96a449/ (probe logs + JSON, gitignored)
- runtime_local/nvidia/{nvngx_dlssnr.dll, runtime-manifest.json}, runtime_local/config/ngx-local.json (gitignored)

Failures and exact codes:

- Gate iterations: runtime:fileversion "310,8,0,0" != "310.8.0.0" (locale) → FileVersionRaw; build exit 1 via ParameterArgumentTransformationError ("-Clean:$false" as string) → omit switch; git check-ignore exit 1 for non-existent trailing-slash dirs → in-directory probe files.
- Compile iterations: C4838 (DXGI literals), WinVerifyTrust const GUID*, namespace log::, wchar→char C4244, IDXGIAdapter1 vs DESC3, ComPtr .Get() for Signal, GetCurrentBackBufferIndex needs IDXGISwapChain3. All fixed; no warnings remain (/WX).

Decision:

- Keep machine-specific paths out of tracked files (build.ps1 resolves them); gate verifies staged state rather than staging itself; probe JSON embeds runId + exe SHA-256 so stale artifacts cannot pass.

Reviewer outcome (P0.9):

- Independent read-only sub-agent reran preflight (exit 0) and phase0 (exit 0, its own run-id a55d5fb41b164abc88fc2760f0b635ec, 300 s / 30003 frames), verified BASE_COMMIT, the full diff (control plane untouched), anti-stale runId/exeSha256 mechanics, and reverse-order cleanup. VERDICT PASS, zero P0/P1.
- Four P2 hardening notes recorded in loop/JOURNAL.md Cycle 009; the fence-timeline ownership item is queued as BACKLOG P1.0a; D3D12 debug-layer absence remains in loop/INBOX.md for the user before Phase 1's debug-layer criterion.

Next single task:

Phase 1 P1.1: phase1 gate + deterministic RGBA8 test frames/output statistics (after P1.0a fence ownership hardening).


## 2026-09-01 Handoff baseline

Goal:

Prepare an implementation contract for the next Agent. No player source has been implemented yet.

Changed:

- Added `AGENTS.md` with project guardrails and phase gates.
- Added `VEYRA_AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK_V1.md` with dependency acquisition, runtime layout, exact Feature 18 parameter contract, parity math, media pipeline, latency rules and phase acceptance criteria.
- Added `.gitignore` before repository initialization so local NVIDIA/RenoDX binaries cannot be added accidentally.

Commands actually run:

- Inspected the project file list and product-spec headings.
- Calculated/verified both local binary identities and Authenticode status.
- Inspected exported/runtime strings and the embedded RenoDX parity shader behavior.
- Verified the installed Windows, RTX 5070/616.56 environment and local Visual Studio/CMake/Ninja/DXC tool paths.
- Checked pinned upstream DLSS, Magpie, FFmpeg/vcpkg and NVOF references.

Results:

- Current repository state before handoff: no `.git` directory and no application source.
- Next allowed implementation phase: Phase 0 only.
- No DLSS Feature was invoked and no runtime test was claimed in this handoff task.

Artifacts/logs:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `VEYRA_AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK_V1.md`
- `VEYRA_PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md`

Failures and exact codes:

- None. One documentation patch wrapper parse error occurred before any write; it was corrected and had no workspace effect.

Decision:

Use direct NGX/D3D12 for V1; signed DLSSNR adapter is local-only; RenoDX add-on is reference-only; start with a native fixed-frame harness before the media player.

Next single task:

Execute Phase 0 from the playbook and stop at its acceptance gate.

## 2026-09-01 Unattended Goal Loop handoff

Goal:

Turn the implementation plan into a recoverable Goal-based loop that another Agent can run without phase-by-phase supervision.

Changed:

- Added loop/LOOP_ENGINE.md with single-writer state machine, evidence rules, retry bounds, independent review and stop/complete conditions.
- Added loop/GOAL_PROMPT.md as the copy-paste Goal task and loop/REVIEW_PROMPT.md as the read-only phase review task.
- Added persistent STATE/BACKLOG/JOURNAL/EVIDENCE/INBOX files.
- Added scripts/loop-gate.ps1 and scripts/gates/README.md.
- Updated AGENTS.md, the Playbook and .gitignore for unattended execution.

Commands actually run:

- powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\loop-gate.ps1 -Gate preflight
- powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\loop-gate.ps1 -Gate phase0
- PowerShell AST parse of scripts/loop-gate.ps1 and ConvertFrom-Json validation of loop/STATE.json.

Results:

- Initial preflight found a Windows PowerShell 5.1 source-encoding bug in a non-ASCII product-plan filename check (exit 1); the bootstrap check was made encoding-safe. The later audit renamed the canonical product spec to an ASCII path.
- Final re-run at 2026-09-01T17:16:32+08:00 passed 45/45 baseline checks (exit 0), including both local binary identities, STATE ledger/limits, ignore rules and eight protected control-file hashes.
- Negative phase0 test failed closed as intended (underlying gate exit 1): Git is not initialized and scripts/gates/phase0.ps1 does not yet exist.
- No application code, NGX Feature, video pipeline or Phase gate was claimed complete.

Next single task:

Start the Goal with loop/GOAL_PROMPT.md. The Agent must rerun preflight, finish P0.1 toolchain/GPU evidence, then execute Phase 0 in backlog order.

## 2026-09-01 Full project audit and cleanup

Goal:

Re-audit the whole handoff package adversarially, remove superseded documentation, repair contradictory implementation instructions, and leave the unattended loop fail-closed for a weaker Agent.

Changed:

- Added `README.md` as the canonical entry point and renamed the retained product boundary to `VEYRA_PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md`.
- Deleted the obsolete V3 plan. It prescribed the superseded quality-first/capture/depth route and had no remaining active references.
- Removed stale Phase 8 and old-plan routing. V1 is strictly Phase 0 through Phase 7.
- Corrected the false premise that the RenoDX `.addon64` is a ReShade configuration. No preset exists in this workspace; Phase 2 uses a declared neutral codec baseline and only performs external-reference comparison if a matching preset/capture is later supplied.
- Removed the D3D11VA/D3D11On12 side route and aligned the minimum codec/container matrix with Phase 3/7 gates.
- Fixed the SR/NVOF circular dependency: V1 SR uses Zero Guidance; full-resolution NVOF is generated after SR and is shared only by NR/FG.
- Added the D3D12VA texture-array slice/plane/lifetime contract, the NVOF ABGR8 input/ring/reset contract, and exact `GetModuleFileNameW` shim edge semantics.
- Recorded the official DLSSG motion-normalization rule and isolated Magpie's conflicting `{1,1}` behavior as a diagnostic-only mode with a deterministic Phase 6 translation gate.
- Hardened `scripts/loop-gate.ps1`: exact nine-file control set, stronger STATE phase/evidence/bound checks, Git commit-pointer checks, representative ignore probes, current-phase enforcement, and before/after hashes that prevent a phase gate from mutating non-ignored project files.
- Rebuilt `loop/CONTROL_HASHES.json` for the canonical control plane.

Commands actually run:

- Official-source checks against NVIDIA DLSS SDK 310.7 headers, NVIDIA Optical Flow documentation/sample behavior, FFmpeg D3D12VA headers, the pinned vcpkg ports and Microsoft `GetModuleFileNameW` documentation.
- PowerShell AST parse, JSON parse for every JSON file, Markdown fence-balance scan, stale-reference/TODO scans, and file inventory checks.
- In-memory unit exercise of `Get-ProjectSourceSnapshot` / `Compare-ProjectSourceSnapshot` without changing disk files.
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\loop-gate.ps1 -Gate preflight`
- Negative gates for `phase0` and out-of-order `phase1`.
- Reversible negative STATE tests for `cycle.completed=80` with active status and for prematurely unlocking Phase 1; the original state was restored after each test.

Results:

- Audited preflight passed 54/54 checks, including nine protected control hashes and both local binary identities.
- `phase0` failed closed because Git is not initialized and `scripts/gates/phase0.ps1` does not exist; no Phase completion was claimed.
- `phase1` additionally failed the current-phase check.
- The loop-bound and phase-sequence mutations each made preflight exit 1 on the intended check, then the valid STATE was restored.
- Mutation-snapshot unit exercise saw 17 control/state files, reported zero changes for identical snapshots, and detected an in-memory README hash change.
- Current project truth remains: no Git repository, no application source, Phase 0 not started.

Deleted/renamed:

- Deleted the obsolete V3 plan. This workspace has no Git history yet, so that deletion is not recoverable from this directory's repository history.
- Renamed the retained product plan to `VEYRA_PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md`; its useful content was audited rather than discarded.

Next single task:

Start the Goal using `loop/GOAL_PROMPT.md`. The first Agent action is the 54-check preflight; then it completes P0.1 and proceeds through Phase 0 backlog order without crossing the gate.

## 2026-09-03 Fast-track V1 scope rebaseline and competitor audit

Goal:

Replace the obsolete player-only route with the user-confirmed first-release scope: physical capture-card enhancement, interactive media player, and image/video export, all sharing one DLSS quality graph. Audit Magpie and recent GitHub competitors before changing the plan.

Facts found:

- Magpie commit `289dc0f6d52075f5a06b47a3f70b35d438095bf5` already contains NVOF motion/confidence, optional Depth Anything V2 Small with temporal reprojection, and DLSSG. Adding a depth texture alone is not a competitive advantage.
- `Merserk/dlss5-visual-enhancer`, `DaniilSokolyuk/video2dlssnr`, `Zonnery/dlss5-nr-player`, `SamG-Coder/dlss5-infinity-studio`, and `jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder` were inspected at source/README level. Details, commit IDs, limitations and licenses are in `docs/COMPETITOR_AUDIT_2026-09-03.md`.
- The screenshot comment's useful lesson is the complete DLSS render contract, not reverse engineering itself. HDMI/video pixels cannot recover engine-native depth/motion/HUD-less buffers; Veyra will use estimated guidance and label it honestly.

Changed:

- Replaced `VEYRA_PRODUCT_SPEC_V1.md` with the three-workflow product definition and measurable Definition of Done.
- Replaced `VEYRA_AGENT_EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK_V1.md` with explicit module layout, dependencies, API contracts, motion/depth/reset rules, source/sink implementation steps and Phase 5–7 gates.
- Added `docs/COMPETITOR_AUDIT_2026-09-03.md`.
- Updated `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, Goal/Loop/Reviewer instructions, gate contract, BACKLOG, STATE and INBOX.
- Expanded the protected control set from 9 to 10 files and rebaselined `loop/CONTROL_HASHES.json`; `scripts/loop-gate.ps1` still fails closed on any drift.
- Preserved Phase 0–4 checkpoints. Invalidated only the old Zero-only Phase 5 evidence because it no longer proves the new quality core.
- Adversarial re-read found and fixed one graph-order contradiction: V1 now states everywhere that SR uses Zero Guidance first, then NVOF/depth/confidence are generated at the post-SR `workingExtent` for Feature 18 and FG. This prevents a weak Agent from building an SR↔NVOF circular dependency or mixing resource extents.
- Verified the local official SDK already contains a signed `nvngx_dlssg.dll` 310.7.0.0 and recorded its exact path/size/hash in the Playbook. It is a Phase 6 staging source, not evidence that DLSSG currently works in Veyra.

Commands actually run:

- Cloned/fetched the six upstream repositories into a unique directory under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp` and inspected files with `rg`/`Get-Content`; no upstream source was copied into Veyra.
- `git status --short --branch`, `rg --files`, JSON parsing, suspicious-text scan, `git diff --check`.
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\loop-gate.ps1 -Gate preflight` → exit 0, 68/68.
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1 -Root <project> -Preset x64-release` → exit 0, Ninja no work to do.

Runtime result:

- This was a control-plane/research task. No new Feature 18, NVOF, DAV2, DLSSG, capture-card or export run was executed. Historical Phase 0–4 runtime evidence was not re-labeled as current product completion.

Known blockers:

- Optical Flow SDK 5.0 headers/sample require the user to accept NVIDIA's EULA and place the SDK under `third_party_local`.
- The final capture gate needs a real DirectShow/UVC device and HDMI test signal.
- Public distribution of NVIDIA runtime/model/FFmpeg assets remains unauthorized.

Next single task:

P5.1: replace the obsolete Zero-only `scripts/gates/phase5.ps1` with the fail-closed Fast-track quality-core gate and prove it fails while unified graph/NVOF/depth implementations are absent.

## 2026-09-03 Launch V1.2 / native-4K rebaseline

User decision:

- Do not ship or accept a minimal MVP. The first release must support native 4K SDR video and retain capture-card, player, image export and video export.

Engineering decisions:

- Native 4K means the Player/Capture/Export graph actually processes 3840x2160; the historical 1080p-to-4K SR harness is not product proof.
- Capture latency is not free lookahead. `NR Low Latency` uses no future frame; `FG Low Latency` needs A/B (`lookaheadFrames=1`); `Buffered Quality` keeps bounded A/B/C (`lookaheadFrames=2`) and uses C only for Veyra consistency/depth/cut/trust, not as a fictional third DLSSG input.
- Replaced the proposed full-frame readback/ffmpeg raw pipe release path with native D3D12 NVENC H.264/HEVC plus libavformat mux. Raw pipe is diagnostic-only and cannot pass Phase 7.
- Added 4K resource pooling, DXGI video-memory budget/headroom, 4K30/60 player gates, real 4K60 capture gate, subtitle layer after FG, settings/dependency/recovery/log-export release behavior.
- Increased the unattended safety limit from 80 to 120 cycles; failure/no-progress limits remain 3/5.
- Added `release_candidate` and `distribution_blocked` state validation. Functional completion cannot be called a public launch while proprietary distribution rights remain unresolved.

Primary references checked:

- NVIDIA NVOFA FRUC programming guide for previous/next frames and forward/backward validation.
- NVIDIA public DLSS-G programming guide for resources and pacing.
- NVIDIA Video Codec SDK 13.1 NVENC guide for D3D12 resources and fence points.
- Elgato official device comparison for the distinction between HDMI passthrough and software preview latency.

Commands actually run:

- JSON parse for STATE/control/config files and PowerShell AST parse for `scripts/loop-gate.ps1`.
- Markdown fence-balance scan.
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\loop-gate.ps1 -Gate preflight` -> exit 0, 70/70.
- `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1 -Root <project> -Preset x64-release` -> exit 0, Ninja no work to do.

Runtime boundary:

- No native-4K Feature 18/NVOF/DAV2/DLSSG/Player/Capture/NVENC Export run was executed in this control-plane turn. None of those features is claimed complete.

New external blockers:

- Video Codec SDK 13.1 EULA/header/sample.
- A real DirectShow/UVC 4K60 SDR capture device, HDMI audio and 4K60 source.
- Public distribution rights for the experimental runtime and bundled assets.

Next single task:

P5.1: replace the obsolete phase5 gate with the Launch V1 1080p60 + native-4K60 fail-closed gate, then prove it fails for the currently missing product graph/guidance implementations.

## 2026-09-03 NVIDIA SDK EULA decision handoff

User decision:

- The user accepts the NVIDIA Optical Flow SDK and Video Codec SDK licensing direction and authorizes their use for local Veyra development.
- This chat record is not evidence that NVIDIA Developer Portal acceptance/download has completed. Both expected SDK directories were checked and remain absent.

State update:

- `loop/INBOX.md` and `loop/STATE.json` now distinguish the resolved product decision from the unresolved package acquisition.
- The next Maker must not ask the user to reconsider the EULA. It should continue P5.1 immediately and only treat the missing Optical Flow package as a concrete blocker when P5.5 needs its headers/sample.
- Video Codec SDK absence does not block Phase 5; it becomes a concrete integration blocker at P7.5.
- No SDK, runtime, driver or source code was installed or changed by this documentation handoff.

Next single task:

P5.1: replace the obsolete Phase 5 gate with the Launch V1 fail-closed quality-core gate and prove the current missing implementation produces exit 1.
